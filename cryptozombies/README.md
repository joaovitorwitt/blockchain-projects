## How Zombie DNA Works

The zombie DNA is a 16 digit integer

3827382190284736

Different parts of this number will map to different traits, like head type, eyes, shirt, etc.

The first two digits are 38, and since we only have 7 head types, we do:

38 % 7 = 3 + 1

Meaning this zombie will have the 4th type of head
